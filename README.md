Hi Git community!

Im FossJar, new to codeing but very knowlegable in the hardware side built my first computer at age 14.   
Have worked in the electrical & IT field for over 17 years want to change over more to the software and codeing 
side. Would be very happy to take any advice or help i can get. I use VScode.
